<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
  of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of
  the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
  colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
  flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
  Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
  page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by
  voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
  CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
  The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
  applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
  is predictable.
  The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
  Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318
  (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of
cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML
documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
 into multimedia web pages.
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"></P><p style="margin-top:10px;">HTML describes the structure of a web page
semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
